Port Shinobi: A Port Scanner specialized in Covert & Advanced Evasion Techniques
============================================================================================

**Description:**
Port Shinobi is a Python-based port scanner designed to evade detection by modern security systems. It employs advanced techniques such as polymorphism, metamorphism, and anti-debugging to remain stealthy while scanning for open ports on a target system.

**Features:**

* Scans for open ports on a target system
* Employs persistence to reconnect to open ports
* Escalates to privileged mode using a custom payload
* Utilizes polymorphic and metamorphic techniques to evade detection
* Includes anti-debugging measures to detect and respond to debugging attempts

**Usage (when executing through CLI/Terminal):**
$ python3 PortSentinel.py <target_ip>

**Requirements:**

* `Python 3.9 or later` Version 
* `socket` library
* `sys` library
* `random` library
* `time` library
* `os` library
